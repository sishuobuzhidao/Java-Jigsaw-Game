# Java-Jigsaw-Game
Created using java swing and IO. The game mechanics is to use arrow keys to move the randomly shuffled images to its original position, so a complete image (or 1~15 if using the classic images) can be seen.
My personal best on a RANDOMLY shuffled image is 42 steps! See if you can beat me! This takes a lot of time to get a start where most tiles are in an ideal position.

I put all useful images into image.zip.

packages:
/codes: all .java files
/素材: all images
      {/GIA
       /Minecraft
       /sishuo
       /wood
       /素材/image: .png that are not used for the main game tiles }

Not all images used are owned by me.
I had a .exe version that can be played directly, but I will not upload that here.
